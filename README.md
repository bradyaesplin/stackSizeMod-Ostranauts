(Early Access) Game is a space-salvage sim. This mod makes a few simple changes to one of the game files to allow for larger item stack sizes, allows an item to be stacked that could not be stacked before the mod, and changes the interior space of the case and fridge items to allow for more storage.

The mod involved changes to a few values in condowners.json and adding one line, and formatting the mod in the manner documented by the developers. This mod was written in response to the developers adding the new modding tutorial and publishing it for testing. As of 2/8/2022 it was working just fine on version 0.8.0.0.
